# Age_detection
Deep-Learning model to detect "Age of the Actors" and classify them into three categories namely-Old, MIddle and Young- using facial feature images. <br>

This repository contains the notebooks that i created for competing in the "AGE DETECTION" competition along with the submission files.
**All the files are in the submission folder itself.**
I dropped the competition midway when the deadline was extended by 96 days, my public leaderboard ranking at that time was 4th (and its still that last i checked).
here is the link for the competition:
